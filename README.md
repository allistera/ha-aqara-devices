`Aqara Devices (Hub G3, Hub M3, FP2 and FP300)` exposes the cloud features of the Aqara Camera Hub G3, Hub M3, Presence Sensor FP2, and Presence Multi-Sensor FP300 directly inside Home Assistant. The integration keeps critical toggles, gesture events, PTZ controls, and presence telemetry in sync so that automations can react instantly without touching the Aqara mobile app.

## Installation

### HACS installationffffff

To install this integration via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/):

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS  
   • Go to **HACS → Integrations → Add Custom Repository**.  
   • Enter `https://github.com/Darkdragon14/aqara-fp2-integration` and pick **Integration**.
2. Search for **Aqara Devices** inside HACS and install it.
3. Restart Home Assistant to load the new component.
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
5. Search for **Aqara Devices** and follow the config flow.

### Manual installation (alternative)

1. Copy the `custom_components/ha_aqara_devices` directory into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the **Aqara Devices** integration from **Settings → Devices & Services**.

## How it works

This integration talks to the same API that the Aqara mobile application uses. The Home Assistant config flow walks you through:

1. **Providing Aqara credentials** – the username/password are encrypted with the Aqara RSA key before being sent to the cloud.
2. **Selecting your cloud area** – EU, US, CN, or OTHER so that requests are routed to the right backend.
3. **Automatic discovery** – the component logs in, fetches all Aqara devices, then keeps `lumi.camera.gwpgl1`/`lumi.camera.gwpagl01` entries (Camera Hub G3), `lumi.gateway.acn012`/`lumi.gateway.agl004` entries (Hub M3), `lumi.motion.agl001` entries (Presence Sensor FP2), and `lumi.sensor_occupy.agl8` entries (Presence Multi-Sensor FP300). All families reuse the same authenticated session.
4. **State syncing** – a coordinator polls `/app/v1.0/lumi/res/query` once per second to collect G3/M3 states, while gesture sensors use `/history/log` timestamps to emulate momentary binary sensors. FP2 devices combine `/res/query`, `/res/query/by/resourceId`, and `/history/log` calls to expose occupancy, sub-zone presence, per-zone counting metrics, heart rate/respiration metrics, illuminance, and configuration flags as entities. FP300 core entities use `/res/query` for presence, temperature, humidity, illuminance, and battery.
5. **Commands** – switches and numbers call `/app/v1.0/lumi/res/write`, PTZ buttons call `/lumi/devex/camera/operate`, and the alarm bell button briefly enables the siren then resets it.

Because the integration must log in on your behalf, make sure the Aqara account has two-factor actions resolved in the official app first, and prefer creating a dedicated Aqara sub-account for Home Assistant if possible.

### Supported entities

#### Hub G3, FP2 and FP300

| Platform | Entities | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Switches (G3)** | Video, Detect Human, Detect Pet, Detect Gesture, Detect Face, Mode Cruise | Toggle the G3 camera processing pipelines remotely. |
| **Buttons (G3)** | PTZ Up/Down/Left/Right, Ring Alarm Bell | Fire PTZ pulses or ring the built-in siren on demand. |
| **Binary sensors (G3)** | Night vision, Gesture V sign/Four/High Five/Finger Gun/OK | Read-only sensors updated every second; gesture sensors stay on for ~10s to emulate momentary presses. |
| **Binary sensors (FP2)** | Presence, Connectivity, Detection Area 1-30 | Occupancy state and online/offline status for each FP2 plus per-area occupancy states. Detection Area entities are disabled by default. |
| **Sensors (FP2)** | People Counting, People Counting (per minute), Whole Area People Count (10s), Zone 1-30 People Count (10s), Zone 1-7 People Count (per minute), Illuminance, Heart Rate, Respiration Rate, Body Movement, Sleep State, installation/mounting metadata, sensitivity/configuration selectors | Combines FP2 telemetry and configuration flags so dashboards and automations can react instantly. Zone-specific count entities are disabled by default. |
| **Binary sensors (FP300)** | Presence | Presence state for the FP300 multi-sensor. |
| **Sensors (FP300)** | Temperature, Humidity, Illuminance, Battery | Core environmental and battery telemetry from the FP300. |
| **Numbers (G3)** | Volume | Adjust the camera speaker volume (0–100). |

Each discovered G3, M3, FP2, or FP300 in your Aqara account gets its own set of entities with device metadata so you can build automations, scenes, or dashboards right away.

To keep Home Assistant entity lists clean, high-cardinality FP2 zone entities are created as **disabled by default**. Enable only the zones you really use in the entity registry.

#### Hub M3 (minimal)

| Platform | Entities | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Numbers** | System Volume, Alarm Volume, Doorbell Volume, Alarm Duration, Doorbell Duration | Control speaker volumes and ring durations. |
| **Binary sensors** | Alarm Status, Device Online, Center Hub Connected | Observe alarm state and connectivity. |
| **Sensors** | Temperature, Humidity | Ambient measurements reported by the hub. |
| **Selects** | Gateway Language, Alarm Ringtone, Doorbell Ringtone | Change hub language and ringtones. |

## Future improvements

* Provide in-UI feedback for failed PTZ or siren commands. :rocket:
* Optionally throttle polling frequency per device to reduce cloud load. :hammer_and_wrench:
* Improve error handling, translations, and diagnostics to simplify troubleshooting. :hammer_and_wrench:
